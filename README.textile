h2. Calipso

Calipso is a simple NodeJS content management system, built along similar themes to Drupal and Wordpress, that is designed to be fast, flexible and simple.

For additional details, including installation instructions, please visit the home page: "http://calip.so/":http://calip.so/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=calipso&utm_campaign=github

If you would like to contribute, please take a look at the issues list as this will have the most up to date view of work that needs to be done for the next minor release.  Otherwise, please just pm myself (cliftonc), dennis (dennishall) or dale (dtan) and we can suggest some places for you to start.

h3. Quick Install

If you want to try it out as quickly as possible, please install MongoDB, ensure that you have the right compilers installed (for OSX, XCode4 will work, for Ubuntu, the build-essential and libssl-dev packages) and then use NPM:

<pre><code>
    npm install calipso -g
    calipso site /var/www/MySite
    cd /var/www/MySite
    calipso server

</code></pre>

h4. Using node v0.5.3

Since node v0.5.3 has removed <code>require.paths</code>, in order to <code>require('lib/calipso')</code>, you must include the following to your file:

<pre><code>
    var rootpath = process.cwd() + '/',
      path = require('path'),
      calipso = require(path.join(rootpath, 'lib/calipso'));

</pre></code>

That also goes for including anything that is based on the root path of the project directory.

h3. Development Steps

To get running in development mode (not the site mode outlined on the front page) - e.g. so you can make changes to core and submit pull requests:

1.  Fork the repository
2.  Clone from your fork (replace YOURNAME!): git clone git@github.com:YOURNAME/calipso.git
3.  Run 'npm install -d' in the clone folder to install all of the dependencies.
4.  Run 'node app' to run Calipso from the source folder.

Note that the bin/calipso command line script is really designed to allow people who just want to use Calipso to build sites to use it, it isn't used in the dev process.  As always, any questions please do shout.

h3. Calipso Command Line Client

The commands currently supported from the command line client are:

h4. Commands That Run Anywhere

<pre><code>
    calipso                            : Show this help file.
    calipso site <name|folder>         : Create site in folder.

</code></pre>

h4. Commands That Run In Site Folder

The most important of these at the moment is 'modules check' (this will ensure that all modules have all of their dependencies installed via npm), and should be run on site install.

<pre><code>
    calipso install                    : Re-run site install.

    calipso cluster server.port=3000   : Run as cluster.
    calipso server server.port=3000    : Run as a single server.

    calipso modules list               : List installed modules.
    calipso modules check              : Check installation of all modules.
    calipso modules install *mod@ver   : Install module@version, or reinstall module.
    calipso modules download github    : Download module from github (e.g. cliftonc/calipso-elastic)
    calipso modules enable *mod        : Enable module.
    calipso modules disable *mod       : Disable module.

    calipso themes list                : List installed themes.
    calipso themes uninstall *theme    : Remove theme (delete from disk)
    calipso themes download *url       : Download (url: http://, gh: cliftonc/calipso-site-theme, repo: calipso-site).
